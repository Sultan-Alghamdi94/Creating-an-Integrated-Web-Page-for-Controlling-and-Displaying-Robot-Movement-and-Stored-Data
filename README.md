# Creating-an-Integrated-Web-Page-for-Controlling-and-Displaying-Robot-Movement-and-Stored-Data

## Introduction

In this project, we will create a web page to display stored data, specifically the latest command issued to a robot. This page will allow users to view the most recent direction command stored in the database, providing real-time insights into the robot's last received instruction.

## Project Description

Database Connection:

Establish a connection to a MySQL database where the command data is stored.

Data Retrieval:

Query the database to fetch the latest command using SQL, ensuring only the most recent entry is displayed.

User Interface:

Present the latest command in a simple and clear format on the web page.

Ensure the page updates to reflect the most current data whenever accessed.

This system will facilitate easy monitoring of the robot's latest command, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency.
